<h1> Galaxies</h1>    
<h2>The Stars Align </h2>    
<p> A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter.Examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with just a few thousand stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting their galaxy's own center of mass. Galaxies have historically been categorized according to their visual morphology, including elliptical, spiral, irregular, and starburst. Many galaxies are believed to have black holes at their active center. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times that of our Sun.</p>
